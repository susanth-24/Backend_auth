# EveryNote
I have created a super awesome web project using JavaScript and EJS, and it's like a magical genie that provides students with exam notes. Students can post a Google Drive link to their notes, and voila, the notes can then be accessed by other students from a global page.

The project uses Express.js and MongoDB, which are like the Batman and Robin of web development. They work together to store and fetch notes, like a superhero duo saving the day.

To make it easy-peasy for students, I added a search function that's like a treasure hunt game. Students can search for notes by keywords or tags and find what they're looking for in a jiffy. And to keep out the bad guys, I added authentication, so only the logged in students can post notes.

Overall, my project is like a wizard that magically makes exam notes appear.
